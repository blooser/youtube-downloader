## Dependency

This software is based on [PySide2](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python) and [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/).

## Features

It allows for customizing your downloads:

- Select where a single download should be stored
- What kind of file it should be
- Pause and resume 

## Usage

Youtube downloader’s goal is comfort. To add your download you can just paste the link into the input and hit enter or press button but I strongly recommend to drag a youtube video’s thumbnail and drop it into youtube downloader.
